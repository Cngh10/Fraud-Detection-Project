# Fraud-Detection-Project
## Predicting fraudulent transactions using machine learning. This project aims to help identify and prevent fraud with a web-based interface.

### 📌 Project Overview

In this project, I built a machine learning model that predicts fraudulent transactions. The model is trained on historical transaction data and deployed via a web application to assist in real-time fraud detection.

### 🔍 Problem Statement

Fraudulent activities can lead to significant financial losses and security risks. By using predictive analytics, we can:

- Identify potential fraud cases
- Understand contributing factors to fraud
- Take preventative actions

## Files
- **`app.py`**: Main Python file for the web application (e.g., Flask or FastAPI) to serve predictions.
- **`Final_xgboost_model.joblib`**: Serialized XGBoost model file trained for fraud detection.
- **`FraudDetection.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook with the model training and evaluation code.
- **`Fraud_Analysis_Dataset.csv`**: Dataset used for training and analysis.
- **`description.txt`**: Additional project description or notes (if applicable).

### 🚀 Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation (XGBoost)
- Accuracy comparison between models
- Confusion matrix and classification report
- Visualization of key insights

### 📊 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- XGBoost
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Flask (for web app in `app.py`)
